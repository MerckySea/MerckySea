- 👋 Hi, I’m @MerckySea
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the basics of coding, but potentially with a focus on cybersecurity in the future. Hacker and the Fed really peaked my intersts but starting feels a bit overwhemling. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning where to start learning the basics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everthing that will give me experience. 
- 📫 How to reach me... I'm working on that.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have physically been inside "the cloud."
